This is a Star Wars RPG Game

The game is published at https://ksmills88.github.io/StarWarsGame/

The goal of the game is to defeat all of your enemies before you run out of health. You will first choose your character. Then, out of the Enemies Available to Attack, you will chose one enemy to start. When you attack them, they will lose health, but so will you. The good news is that for every time you attack, your attack power doubles. Each character has a different attack power, and each enemy has a different counter-attack power. There is no way to re-gain your health, so choose your character and enemies wisely. If you lose all of your health, you lose the game. If you defeat one enemy, you will choose another enemy to attack. If you can defeat all of your enemies, you win the game. Good luck!
